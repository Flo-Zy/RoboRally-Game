# Welcome to the game RoboRally 

## Getting started

To start the game download the target.zip folder and unpack it.
Start a cmd window and run the server.jar using java -jar server.jar.
Then open as many cmd windows as you want players in your game.
In each cmd window use the client.jar to start your client as follows: java -jar client.jar.

## Rules of the game

You will first have to enter your name and choose a robot. Then you can connect to the game and get to the lobby.
In the lobby press the "ready" button to enter the game. You might have to wait a little until enough players are ready.
The first player pressing ready gets to choose a map.
You can chat with the other players either in the group chat or privately by selecting the player below the chat window.
You can mute or adjust the volume of the music and sounds on the right hand side at the bottom of the screen.
After choosing the map you can program your robots selecting five out of the nine cards you were dealt.
But be careful you can fall off the sides of the map. 
Beware of the field elements and the robot lasers that activate after each of the five registers.
The first player to reach all checkpoints in the right order wins the game.
Have fun and let the chaos unfold!
